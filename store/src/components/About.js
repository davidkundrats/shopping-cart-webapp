          My name is david kundrats and it's been a longstanding goal of mine to{" "}
          create a dark room of my own. I use an omega c62 enlarger head with a
          80mm f5 el-nikkor lens and print on ilford paper. Photos are either
          shot on a Leica m2 or Olympus XA. All sizes for orders are 5x7 and
          will have above standard contrast. If you have certain preferences,
          please leave them in the order notes for me to fufill.{" "}
